INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Make sure you edit the IP address and port inputs at the very bottom of EACH program, and change it to an open port and attacking machine IP address.
2. If you do want to try to hack into a different machine, use pyinstaller to convert the python file into an executable. You can install pyinstaller by entering 'pip install pyinstaller' into the terminal and typing 'pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole <python file name> <new file name>. You can change the file extension to work on different operating systems. For example, the new file name could be example.exe for Windows or example.app for MacOS.
3. Be sure to run the listener before the reverse shell. The reverse shell connects back to the listener, not vice versa.
